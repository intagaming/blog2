# Software development education in Vietnam is extremely uncertain

![cover](/images/laptop-coding.jpeg)

Someone who's teaching you right now might never be able to join the job market
anymore.

Let's keep this short. Some backgrounds:

- I have a career goal of becoming a Backend Developer, and I start with
  Frontend.
- I'm currently a 3rd year at FPT University.
- I am getting paid (minimum middle-class salary) _as an Intern_ to work in a
  Frontend project.
- **I'm 20.**

## So you want to be a Frontend Developer

- You **need** a _Frontend framework_. Your school only go so far as basic HTML
  & CSS (on Coursera, _go figure_). No JavaScript. So just with this first point
  alone, you can't get into the job market after 4 years of university.
- **A professor** teaching C# and C# Web Development **doesn't know how to
  proficiently write JavaScript**, let alone ES6 variant.
- **They don't teach you Git**. I doubt any one of them is knowledgeable enough
  to teach Git.

Well, at least they're teaching Java, C# and SQL Server for doing Backend works,
right?

## They only produce Backend developers! - you said

- **Nobody teaches you API stuff.** REST API, GraphQL, it's non-existent.
- **To be a Backend Developer is no easy feat.** Look at
  [the backend roadmap][1] _down to the near bottom_, that's where the _Junior
  Backend_ guy is. Doubt? I am a living proof of having worked with a Junior
  Backend guy.
- **Backend is like a dangerous world.** If your data is gone or leaked, your
  company is gone. If your server goes down for 30 seconds, for example the
  server of an eCommerce website, and they can't place an order, they would
  probably never come back.
- **No one hires a freshly graduated student to work in Backend.** Try to find a
  Junior Backend job that a graduate can work in. With Frontend, I can probably
  just try my luck on a Junior Frontend interview right now and no one's
  complaining.

## What about Business Analyst?

**I don't know.** You could try, but you will probably end up at a Fresher
position and learn another year. I can't say the things they teach at FPT is
beneficial to your job, all I can say is that **what I'm doing at work is far
from what I think I'd do**.

You really have to learn the hard way, and at scale.

## So what? Afterall, I am a Fresher now. - you said

You really think that it takes 4 years for a person to be able to work as a
Fresher. Well _joke's on you_, because not only there're people who only need
**at most 2 years to become a Fresher**, by the time you graduated, they would
already be a Junior and have **tripled** your salary.

Let that sink in for a second. You will graduate at 21. **I'm 20 and I have the
ability to build a software of a Junior Developer.**

## Conclusion

- Going to Software university in Vietnam is not a career start.
- Junior Backend is easier said than done.
- 4 years is the time it takes to become a Junior, not a Fresher.
