# About the hesitancy in reading Software Engineering writings

![cover](/images/docs.png)

Over my university years, I've noticed that my peers don't have a keen on
reading technological writings, i.e. tech documentations, or articles on a tech
topic. They prefer watching videos or, somewhat unfortunately, read articles
that are "easy to understand" but lack the credibility or depth, usually from
incompetent writers (I'll show you some).

There is nothing wrong with how you perceive information, but if you are _so_
determined on not reading the documentation for a piece of software from its
creators, I can confidently tell you that you are doing things fundamentally
wrong. How wrong, you ask?

## An example of skipping documentations

Granted, some documentations are just utterly awful (I'm looking at you, _Java
documentation_). But let's look at a proper, **manly** documentation.

_NOTE: A technical writing on a specific topic that is referenced by the
maintainers of the software could be considered a documentation. Examples can be
[the Next.js' documentation][6]._

You want to learn _Node.js_. One-liner: _Node.js_ is the thing that runs
JavaScript outside of the browser, and you want to learn _Node.js_ to write
backends with JavaScript. So you look for a tutorial.

Let's hit YouTube, the _default_ source of graduates' knowledge. Here's one:

![Node.js Tutorial YouTube](/images/nodejs-tutorial-youtube.png)

"8 hours!?" says a graduate. They proceed anyway. How many of you actually went
through an 8-hour tutorial and feels superior afterwards?

Here's how I would do it. I go to Google and search for _Node.js_, and click the
official _Node.js_ website, `nodejs.org`. I click _Docs_, then _Guides_, and
then _Getting Started Guide_. Just one more step, I click _Introduction to
Node.js_ highlighted in green color.

Here I am, the link that's recommended by the Node.js officials, _Introduction
to Node.js_:

![Introduction to Node.js](/images/introduction-to-nodejs.png)

As a newcomer, not only this page tells me what is Node.js, it also instructs me
about what I need to know before learning _Node.js_. The _Getting Started_
section does exactly what it implies: **Getting Started**.

![The Node.js fs module](/images/nodejs-fs-module.png)

Take the page _The Node.js fs module_ for example, which is the "File System"
module. It is as concise as it is possible. I'm sure you can read this in 5
minutes. Not only the YouTube version 3 times lengthier, if you need to review
something, you might be lost rewinding the video to a very specific timestamp
instead of just scrolling by maybe half a page.

If you value your time, then I think I have to persuade you no more.

## "I can NOT focus when reading!"

That's totally fine! I could say this much to you: There are incredible sources
from ingenious people in your subject of interest that are **only** available
through books or writings of some sort. The choice is yours.

Here's what's needed for an article to be "engaging" (for me):

- The article must be **exactly** what I seek.
- The article must be in good format. No unnecessary wordings to waste my time.
- **I know everything that the article presents but doesn't explain.**
- The article must lead me somewhere. **I must be able to guess things ahead of
  time.**
- Skim-able.

Before you go, I have some not-the-best-quality writings that I want to show
you, so you'd know what kind of writings to avoid.

## Bad Writing Examples: "Backend Development Is Not Hard"

[Source.][1]

This article was on daily.dev one day. I had skimmed through it.

_TL;DR_: A short "What is a web server?" section, followed by a tutorial on
installing Node.js, Express.js and run an HTTP server.

Is this whole article justifies the "Backend Development Is Not Hard" statement
in the title? I'll get straight into the weeds: Backend Development is **hard**.
Doubt? Go on and do backend for a month, maybe two, then evaluate your knowledge
with the [Backend Roadmap][2].

Does a doctor say, "Being doctor is easy feet"?

You get the point. Nothing is easy, and if someone tells you otherwise, they are
trying to sell you something.

If I were a backend newbie, and I want to use JavaScript, I would do the Node.js
Getting Started, then trying to create a backend immediately. Maybe I need a
database, or need a config file, or `async`, or maybe Load Balancing, but until
I need those, I don't care, and **no one** will try to teach me things I don't
care _yet_.

## Bad Writing Examples: "Git branching for small teams"

[Source.][3]

This is an article in the "Top" page of `dev.to`. "Elite", you might say.

One question only: Do you **really** need to branch?

If you can't answer this question (or the article doesn't say, as in the article
above), you should not read this article at all, or any "Git branching guide".
[Here's why you don't branch (mostly), if you are interested.][4] It's like
learning how to fly a plane without knowing **why** you need to do so.

This article doesn't explain the situations when you might need to branch. Don't
assume you always branch. Additionally, I don't think I will read this anytime
soon. I consider this article "misleading", especially for newcomers.

If you have no idea why you're reading the thing, don't.

## Bad Writing Examples: Step-by-step coding articles

Didn't come up with any particular example. But there are some identifying
features:

- A big wall of code.
- Doesn't explain everything. Yeah, I need **everything** in a coding article to
  be explained, or at least self-explanatory.
- Heavily, but badly opinionated.
- Use of external packages that are not essential.

It takes skills to read these kind of articles, otherwise it has **big**
consequences. If you can't identify good coding, close the tab and stick to the
basic.

Hope you will find some good articles to read soon. Here's one I've read today:
