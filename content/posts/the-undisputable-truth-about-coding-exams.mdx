# The undisputable truth about "coding exams"

![cover](/images/code.jpeg)

Did you not remember the damn Math.pow() in your foreign programming language?

I’m Vietnamese. I had to take a subject about _Introduction to Programming_ back
in high school, with _Pascal_. Do I remember how to **quadruple a number** in
_Pascal_? No, of course not. I’ve recently learned about _C#_, not that I want
to use it, it’s because it’s in my university curriculum. Do I remember how to
**quadruple a number**, or the syntax to create **an event a.k.a. delegate
storing variable** in _C#_? No either. Google for the rescue, right? Right?

**Ha.** It’s exam day and you are expected to recall from memory _all_ the
syntaxes those intelligent people invented, **just to do the same exact thing**
thats **engraved in your brain** to a point where your blood vessels in your
brain is _boiling, expanding and shrinking_ so that it can interpret into C#.
Not only your school teaches you to use WinForm in the “Basic **Cross-Platform**
Application Programming With .NET”, they also want you to be a sole **coding
machine** with exceptional memory of a **documentation**, AND intellect to
suddenly knows the knitty things that they didn’t even teach.

Bottom line is, you should be ashamed to pay them to teach you these
_Introduction to Programming_ courses. The documentations exist for a reason;
it’s **awaiting** your **usage**. Have you had a taste of the “coding on paper”
exams?
