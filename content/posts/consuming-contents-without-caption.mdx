# Consuming contents without caption

![cover](/images/content-consuming.jpeg)

English is my first non-native language that I can read and understand
reasonably well, though I could never speak or write sharply because I have
never been in an environment that required me to do so. Through years of
consuming YouTube, I've developed the ability to understand English, not
extensively, but enough that I don't need to pull out a Google Translate.

Historically, for about 4-5 years, I had been a **heavy** English caption user.
That really propelled me to get a grasp of English. However, I have noticed
recently that with the caption taking up space on my screen sitting and popping
trying to get my attention, I couldn't focus on the content itself. It might be
a person trying to talk to me, or a graph that's displaying informations, _I
just kind of ignored them_. And I thought, that's kind of a bummer.

Once I could understand roughly what the narrative has to say without a caption,
I think that's the point where I should quit abusing caption all the time. I
would now solely use caption in the instance where there are a heavy
journalistic narrative going on that I could never completely catch because I
were not born using the language, or at best trying to see the word that sounded
foreign to me. Now the screen is less cluttered, and I could really see the
person's expression when they're talking.

This is really the experience I've always been dreamed of since the day that I
decided to consume English contents. I think the same could be said for watching
a film in foreign language, though I've never been fond of watching films
myself.
