# The art of self-studying

![cover](/images/book-and-pen.jpg)

It doesn't have to be messy.

There is a bigger problem here. To all the _self-study advice giving_ people,
**should you go to university?**

There are two problems I want to address here:

- Who can be classified as "self-studying",
- What "the self-study people" do.

I indeed have seen many _self-study advice giving_ figures out there, **to
university students**. It is **a must** to self-study (a whole different topic
that I won't touch in this blog). What I don't understand is, given no
information about the advisor's profile, _what is the point_? Then when asking
about it, **they said** that they are having "a successful position". That was
some time ago (sadly). Sure, they might be in a good position(?). But,

> that makes you a person that the society needs.

How do I know that they **surely** went to an university? Because they put
"Studied X at University of Y" on their profile.

What you want, in the end, is the knowledge to be able to provide values (to
make money, to live). Who can teach you that? **A teacher**, of course. Teachers
teach at schools. Here's the problem: Suppose you are a student who wants to
make _that app you book foods and rides_ (Software Engineer), you go to school
to learn programming. **Is the curriculum outdated? Have you tried to answer
that question?**

I can say with confidence that **one** single year in Software age is not 365
days, **it's a matter of getting a job.** Ask the teachers. **They don't work in
the industry.** Proves: Ask them to get in an interview with employers. Then
they would learn that new knowledge to work that job, **except you learn the old
knowledge from them.** What's funny, they usually don't make that old knowledge
go away. _They teach them_. 10 years ago, someone **was** hiring them. Look
again, it's 2021, do they have the knowledge to teach someone to work in 2022?

## Who can be classified as "self-studying"

First of all, how do you find the time to _self-study_ in university life? You
must be a prodigy.

Self-studying, in _the university sense_, is learning **new things** outside of
your learning schedule **(including homework)**. You can't. (if you learn at
schools properly)

Do you see a paradox here? You go to school to learn, and you need to
self-study. Why do I need to self-study _when I'm literally studying myself_?

Self-studying, in _my_ definition, is studying. You do that everyday. Why? What
would you do when your professor says something that needs to be more clear? You
ask them, and you are doing yourself a favor by self-studying, which if you
don't, you're just learning from textbook.

So you **are** self-studying. Knowledge comes to each person differently
(because different knowledge backgrounds), and you need to learn it your way.
Makes sense?

## What “the self-study people” do

### Being a sharp candidate

Have you ever question the things _the self-study people_ learn? They learn _new
things_? Not quite. Think about it, do you know how to repair an airplane's
engine? Probably not. _It is not a new thing_, but it is for you.

Most importantly, they learn how to get a job, and **a better job**, and a $100k
job, and a $200k job. Isn't that what schools teach you? No. By the time you
finish your 4 years of university (that teach technologies at least), it's like
if you are a prisoner seeing an iPhone. _The self-study people_ learns as if
tomorrow they would apply for a job, instead of _an university student_, who
will apply for a **4-years-ago** job. Do you see the difference that is
not-so-little obvious?

There's a reason why medical schools is more prestige and highly-appreciated
than others. It is a fact that science never gets old. Same as Computer Science.
Now then, medical students use science everyday, as well as we technical people
use technology everyday. The old Flu cures still cures Flu. In other hands, if
your Android phone gets old, can you guess whether it will hold its value as
well as the Flu vaccine? Even the medical students still have to figure out the
new machines and scissors they'd need to do things better.

That **is** the point. **New things do things better.** Now who do employers
looking for? Someone who gets the job done. Would they employ a **4 years
behind** employee?

### "The Essentialist"

Besides "lacking-behind" reasons (of being unemployed), the university students
have to spend their time learning things they don't use for their first job **at
all**. Before you reasoning with me that

> You learn foundation for your future jobs, it's a skill that you will use to
> raise your salary.

**No.** Can you still do juggling _after a year_, which at the time you didn't
perform before audience's eyes **even once?** Why do you waste 4 years
practicing, building up that juggling skill, just so to not use it for **one
single year**, and still expect to do juggling? What were you thinking before
making a decision to spend 4 years doing juggling? **You will die! You don't
have infinite lifetime!**

Not all things are of no use. But as if it is equally useless for me to learn to
repair an airplane's engine, it is the same for you to learn things just to not
use it. _Like humans_, we will forget how to walk on four legs, and spend half
of them grabbing instead. We remember things that are essentials.

## To be an artful student

Don't tell me that you don't have any objective in your life. You sure do. Like
having _a sweet, soft bed_ to goof off of. Then you would want _a laziest way_
to achieve them. But you are not lazy, you are trying to be _smart_, just like
when you're trying to get as much money as soon as possible. You will know which
way is the best **by instinct**. Just as people don't want you to be _overly
smart_, doesn't mean it is necessary a bad thing for you.

An artful student selectively learns what is **essentials** and **effective**.
Don't let anyone tell you to learn to repair an airplane's engine. **You**
choose your knowledge.
