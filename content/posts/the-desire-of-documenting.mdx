# The desire of documenting

![cover](/images/document.jpeg)

Think, at which point in time do you want to document things?

That's right. _You don't_ **until** you need to _reflect_ on them.

> But what you mean by "reflect"? Why? I'm living!

You'd be right. Now, do you know the legend, in which that guy suddenly had a
$20 bill in his jacket's pocket? What's the lesson anyway?

## _Wha..?_

_Reflecting_, in my own terms, means to transfer the same energy to others. In
other words, you must **be able to explain** that thingy to people.

Imagine this. You break one's heart. They go,

> Why?

Why? You may know the answer (_just be **sure** to curb your mouth_). Now a week
later you _reflect_ on that, except _you don't_.

Are you bad and _rebound_? (please don't). Or did you not **documenting**?

Personal story time: _That's me_ (not the rebound part). Though I did talk to
people, so I _was_ documenting. By talking about it, I got a second chance to
think about that same thing. And I did **fifteen**, just to be sure. Now that's
what I call a _refreshing_ story.

## _"Wastes time."_

Look, you better have your reasoning **and** be responsible. On the flip side is
what they describe _a potato_. Do yourself a favor.

Alright, let me give you an example of "reflecting".

There's a _tippity tappity_ point, something the _modern_ people called
**_"antiquated"_**.

Great things charm the whole history, like Mozart and Da Vinci. Then there's
**contemporary education system** to join the conversation.

You can, **today**, [send me](mailto:xuanan2001@gmail.com) what knowledge you
could extract out of 4 years of university that can make you get in the $500 job
interview. I **will** make sure to include that _right in this blog here_ for
proper reference. Mark my word. Make sure that it makes you **totally eligible**
to work after **4 years**.

I am to blame when you people ~~teach me~~ **put me in** a **$300/mon** job and
tell me that I need **2 more years**, just in case **4 university years** does
not suffice, to have a position in the industry.

Now where do I start _documenting_ this? Betcha knows, I document this **to a
great extent**. About _that school project_, how about asking your grandkid how
they feel about Internet Explorer. Must've been an _exciting_ TED talk.

## How much?

_Just enough_ to get you out of _depression_, whatever that means.

You see, talk all day and you'll hear words flying,

> Shut up you **f\_\_\_** piece of dress-wielding **c\_\_\_** head!

In contrast, don't talk and you'd be a **well-known** middle-class person.

If you want an advice from a 20s, **_well_** you arrive at the right god-damn
section:

_Reflect_ on what can be classified as **a milestone** in your conscious
eternity, either to _flex_ on it _or_ to be a proud member of The Boomers.

## How?

Talk. Or write blogs (oh well.)

> **get/set** methods. The more you know.)_

## Reflecting

Did you document anything from this blog post?
