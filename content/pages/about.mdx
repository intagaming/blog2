# About

## Hi!

My name is _An Hoang_. I'm currently a third year Software Engineering student
at FPT University (as of Q4 2021), though most of my knowledge comes from
[self-studying][1] and pre-university [self-studying][1] (basically all
[self-studying][1]).

I'm interested with things technology-related. Mobile, desktops, or “tech” as in
“technology to build software”. I want to know **the mindset** behind those, and
what **problem** it's trying to solve. Consequently, I want to build
applications. That's it. Oh, and hobby: music listening, gaming.

## Purpose

I have a **radical** perspective against my (and possibly other Vietnamese)
university.

The **absolute** primary theme of my blog is to tell **the truth about my
university**, how it _prevents_ us from advance into our _real_ career start. I
made a promise to **never include my university education in my CV**. I want to
see what I can do with my knowledge rather than a _less-than-truthful_ degree. I
speak what I experienced **only**.

Otherwise, I document what I learn along my career. Exploring the internet is
very fun in this day and age, but there's quirks. I document **every bit of
code** I've write (not in the sense that you'd imagine). What I don't want to
see is any snippet of code that I don't understand, that's probably either **too
complex** or I was crazy to add it in. There's also many **thought process**
which I would document _to [reflect on][2]_ what I had learned.

## Contact

You can find me on [my contact](/contact). Happy to talk with you about things
we share in common!
