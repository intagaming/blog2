# About

## Hi!

My name is _An Hoang_. I'm currently a last-year Software Engineering student at
FPT University and will be graduating Q1 2023, though most of my knowledge comes
from [self-studying][1] and pre-university [self-studying][1]. Yeah, you could
say that I'm a big fan of [self-studying][1].

I'm interested with things technology-related. Mobile, desktops, or “tech” as in
“technologies to build software”. I want to know **the mindset** behind those;
what **problem** it's trying to solve. I like building applications. That's it.
Oh, hobbies: music listening, gaming, geeking out, aviation.

## Purpose

I have a **radical** perspective against my (and possibly other Vietnamese)
university.

The **absolute** primary theme of my blog is to tell **the truth about my
university**, how it _prevents_ us from advancing into our _real_ career start.
I made a promise to **never include my university education in my CV**. I want
to see what I can do with my knowledge rather than an (in my opinion) expensive
and sugarcoated degree. I speak what I experienced **only**.

Otherwise, I document what I learn along my career. Exploring the internet is
very fun in this day and age, but there's quirks. There're also many **thought
processes** which I would document _to [reflect on][2]_ what I had learned.

## Contact

You can find me on [my contact](/contact). Happy to talk with you about things
we share in common!
